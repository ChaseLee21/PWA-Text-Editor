# Text Editor Progressive Web App
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](#license)

  ## Description
  This project was apart of my coding bootcamp at University of Oregon for web development. In this project I was given some starter code and my task was to finish the project. The goal of this project was to create a progressive web application that a user could download on their machine through their broweser. Two major technologies were used in this project: webpack and express.js. This project also implements a service worker to cache images, script files, and css files. Code Mirror was also used in this project to implement the front end functionality of the text editor. The main part of this project that I worked on was implementing a backend db using the browsers built in indexedDB, registering a service worker for caching, and creating a webpack.config.js file that would correctly install the application on a users machine and load / configure plugins.
